I'm a PhD student at the VU University Amsterdam. My research focuses on combining symbolic reasoning and machine learning, or "Neuro-Symbolic AI". I've done work on [differentiable fuzzy logics](arxiv.org/abs/2002.06100), and on optimization with discrete latent variables. I'm also interested in Personal Knowledge Management and developed some plugins for [Obsidian](Obsidian.md).

## Projects
- [Storchastic](https://github.com/HEmile/storchastic): A PyTorch library which implements many gradient estimation methods.
- [Juggl](https://github.com/HEmile/juggl): Obsidian plugin that adds a useful and customizable graph view.
- [Graph Analysis](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/graph-analysis): Uses graph theory algorithms to find similarities between Obsidian notes.
- [Supercharged Links](https://github.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links): Allows styling your Obsidian links.
