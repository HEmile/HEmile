I'm a PostDoc student at the University of Edinburgh. My research focuses on combining symbolic reasoning and machine learning, or "Neuro-Symbolic Learning". I'm also interested in Personal Knowledge Management and developed some plugins for [Obsidian](Obsidian.md). I'll soon obtain my PhD at the VU Amsterdam.
